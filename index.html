      Dear Sulaim, <br><br>
      I know that I may have hurt you in some way, and for that, I truly apologize. <br>
      You mean the world to me, and our friendship is something I deeply value. <br><br>
      Please forgive me, and let's move forward together as the best of friends. <br>
      Thank you for always being there for me, and I promise to be a better friend.
