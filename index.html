        <h1>Dear Sulaim,</h1>
        <p id="letter-content">
            I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my recent actions. 
            I realize that I may have hurt you, and that was never my intention. Your friendship means a lot to me, 
            and I regret any pain I may have caused.
        </p>
        <button id="show-more" onclick="toggleMore()">Show More</button>

            I value our friendship deeply and I want to make things right. I am committed to being a better friend 
            moving forward. Thank you for your understanding, and I hope we can put this behind us.
        </p>
        <p>Warm regards,<br>Your Friend</p>
